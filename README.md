## Turning Surplus Food into Timely Meals

HopePlates is a real-time food redistribution platform built to reduce food waste and combat hunger by connecting event organizers with nearby NGOs, orphanages, and old-age homes.

Rather than allowing surplus food to go unused, HopePlates ensures it reaches people who need it — quickly, efficiently, and responsibly through smart technology and real-time coordination.
